## Paint App with Computer Vision

The Realtime Paint App with Computer Vision leverages hand gesture recognition to enable users to draw on a digital canvas using their hands in real time. Built with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe, it detects hand landmarks and translates movements into interactive drawing actions. This app offers a fun and intuitive way to create art through natural hand gestures!
